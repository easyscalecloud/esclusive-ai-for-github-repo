About the ``bin`` folder
==============================================================================
The ``bin`` folder (bin stands for binary) is a Linux convention that stores the executable scripts.

For Python development workflow automation, we organize automation operations into groups. Within each group, there are tasks, and each task consists of multiple steps.

The naming convention for these scripts is ``g01_t02_s03_{name}.py``

- g stands for Group
- t stands for Task
- s stands for Step

Groups:

- Group 1: virtual environment setup
- Group 2: Dependency management
- Group 3: Testing
- Group 4: Documentation
- Group 5: Build and Publish Package
- Group 6: Setup SAAS platform
